DongerDong
=================

A simple IRC bot for fighting, written in Python.

"All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who donger are lost; The old that do dong do not wither, Deep roots are not donged by the frost. From the ashes a dong shall be woken, A light from the dongers shall spring; Renewed is donger that was broken, Donger dong dong, donger dong." -J.R.R. Tolkien
